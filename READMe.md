# Knight travails

solution to the Odin project algorithms assignment.

implementation of the shortest path a knight can take from start to end point
it shows all the points a knight will stop along the way.

for example input : knigtMoves([7, 1], [3, 1])

outputs :
You made it in 2 moves, here is the path:
[7,1]
[5,0]
[3,1]

might revisit later to add a user interface, for now we move.
